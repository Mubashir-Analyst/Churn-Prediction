# Project Title: 
Customer Churn Prediction Model 

# Project Overview:
The Customer Churn Prediction project is designed to help a telecom company reduce customer churn by developing a predictive model using Python and machine learning algorithms. The model will identify customers who are at risk of leaving the company, allowing proactive retention efforts to be deployed and ultimately increasing customer retention rates.

# Project Objectives:

Data Collection: Gather historical customer data, including usage patterns, billing information, customer demographics, and customer service interactions.

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Transform and engineer features for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and understand factors that contribute to customer churn.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features and variables that are predictive of churn, such as call duration, contract length, payment history, and customer complaints.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction. Commonly used algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

Model Training: Train the selected machine learning models on historical data, using a portion of the data for training and the rest for validation and testing.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to assess their ability to predict churn.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model hyperparameters to optimize predictive performance.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model into the telecom company's systems for real-time churn prediction.

# Project Deliverables:

Cleaned and Preprocessed Data: A clean and well-structured dataset ready for analysis.

Churn Prediction Model: Trained machine learning models capable of predicting customer churn.

Model Evaluation Report: Documentation of model performance, including metrics and insights.

Codebase: Python code and Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Expected Benefits:

Reduced customer churn and increased customer retention rates.
Improved customer targeting for retention efforts.
Cost savings from retaining valuable customers.
Enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Data-driven decision-making for proactive customer retention strategies.
By building a customer churn prediction model using Python and machine learning, this project aims to empower the telecom company with the ability to identify and retain customers at risk of churning, ultimately leading to increased profitability and customer satisfaction.
